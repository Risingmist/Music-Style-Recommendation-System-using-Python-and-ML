# Music Style Recommendation System using Python and ML

The Music Style Recommendation System is designed to suggest music genres/styles tailored for different individuals based on their age and gender preferences. Python serves as the primary programming language, and the implementation employs the Decision Tree algorithm from Machine Learning.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to recommend suitable music styles considering age and gender. By utilizing the Decision Tree algorithm, the system learns patterns and correlations between age, gender, and preferred music genres to provide personalized recommendations.

## Features

- Personalized Recommendations: Suggests music styles based on individual age and gender preferences.
- Decision Tree Algorithm: Utilizes the Decision Tree algorithm for pattern recognition and recommendation generation.
- Python Implementation: Developed entirely using Python for easy accessibility and understanding.

## Implementation Details

The project utilizes the following components and techniques:

- Decision Tree Algorithm: Implements the Decision Tree algorithm from the scikit-learn library to create a model for music style recommendation.
- Data Preprocessing: Handles data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for model training.
- Python Programming: Entire project is developed using Python for simplicity and flexibility.
